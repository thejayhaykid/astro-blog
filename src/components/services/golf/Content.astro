          Can you think of something you would like help with that isn't listed
          on this page? Ask me about it! I would love to discuss potential
          blindspots I have in the industry.

        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-secondary-foreground">
          I pride myself on being able to pickup and learn things quickly. Even
          if I have not heard of it before, I will take the time to figure it
          out. If it could be beneficial to your business, I would love to hear
          more about it.
