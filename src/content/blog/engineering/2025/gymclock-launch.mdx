I’m excited to share that my first solo App Store app, **GymClock**, ships today for Apple TV. It’s the workout timer I wanted in my own home gym: big, glanceable, simple, and distraction‑free.

## Why GymClock?

I kept propping my phone against a dumbbell just to see the time. GymClock turns your TV into a simple wall clock and timer so you can stay focused.

## What’s inside at launch

- **Wall clock** that stays visible from anywhere in the room
- **Stopwatch with laps** for sets, rounds, or EMOM tracking
- **Countdown timers** for intervals and rest periods
- **Light & dark modes** tuned for different gym setups
- **Offline first** — everything runs locally on Apple TV
- **No ads or tracking** — just a clean, focused experience

## Who it’s for

- Home and garage gyms
- Interval and strength training
- Anyone who wants a clear timer without grabbing a phone
