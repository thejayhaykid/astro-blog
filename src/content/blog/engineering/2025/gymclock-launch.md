I’m excited to share that **GymClock** ships this Monday for Apple TV. It’s the workout timer I wanted in my own garage gym: big, glanceable, and distraction‑free.

## Why GymClock?

I kept propping my phone against a dumbbell just to see the time. GymClock turns your TV into a simple wall clock and timer so you can stay focused.

## What’s inside at launch

- **Wall clock** that stays visible from anywhere in the room  
- **Stopwatch with laps** for sets, rounds, or EMOM tracking  
- **Countdown timers** for intervals and rest periods  
- **Light & dark modes** tuned for different gym setups  
- **Offline first** — everything runs locally on Apple TV

## Who it’s for

- Home and garage gyms
- Interval and strength training
- Anyone who wants a clear timer without grabbing a phone

## Launch day

The App Store link goes live Monday. Want a reminder or early feedback channel? [Ping me](/contact?subject=Tell%20me%20when%20GymClock%20is%20live).

Thanks for supporting indie builders — can’t wait for you to try it.
