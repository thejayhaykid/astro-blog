I’m excited to share that **Gym Clock**, a simple workout clock designed for Apple TV, has been submitted to the App Store and is currently pending review.

This is a small app, but it solves a problem I kept running into during my own workouts: I wanted a big, always-visible clock and timer on my TV without distractions, notifications, or a phone sitting nearby.

## Why I Built It

Most workout timers are designed for phones. That works fine — until you’re mid-set, across the room, or trying to stay focused without grabbing another device.

Gym Clock turns your TV into a clean, easy-to-read gym clock that stays visible throughout your workout. No accounts. No ads. No noise.

## What It Does

Gym Clock includes:

- A large wall-style clock you can see from anywhere in the room
- A stopwatch with lap tracking for rounds and sets
- Custom countdown timers for intervals, rest, and circuits
- Light and dark mode to fit different gym setups

Everything runs locally on Apple TV and works offline.

## Who It’s For

Gym Clock is built for:

- Home and garage gyms
- Strength training and interval workouts
- Anyone who wants to keep their phone out of their hands during training

If you’ve ever propped your phone against a dumbbell just to track time, this app is for you.

## What’s Next

Once the app is approved, it will be available on the App Store for Apple TV. I’ll share the link here as soon as it’s live.

After launch, I plan to keep the app focused and simple while continuing to improve polish, performance, and usability based on real-world use.

If you’re interested in trying it out or have feedback once it’s live, I’d love to hear from you.

Thanks for reading — and for supporting independent builders.
