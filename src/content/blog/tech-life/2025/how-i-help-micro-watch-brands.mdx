I love micro watch brands. They‚Äôre small, scrappy, and driven by people who actually care about design, craftsmanship, and storytelling. But if you‚Äôre running one, you already know it‚Äôs a ton of work. You‚Äôre designing, managing suppliers, handling customer questions, shipping orders, and trying to keep the brand alive all at once. 

The tech side? It often gets pushed to the bottom of the list. That‚Äôs where I come in.

## The Common Challenges Micro Brands Face

Most of the founders I talk to run into the same problems:

- Setting up (and actually maintaining) an online store  
- Payments, shipping, and international customers  
- Getting marketing tools working (email lists, reviews, preorders)  
- Making sure the site doesn‚Äôt break when a new drop goes live  
- Just not having enough time or bandwidth to deal with all of it

## How I Help

Here‚Äôs how I usually step in:

- **E-commerce setup & optimization**  
  I make Shopify (or whatever platform you use) actually work the way you need it to. Clean, fast, and easy to buy from.  I‚Äôm a Shopify Partner who can work in other setups too. 

- **Technical integrations**  
  Email flows, preorder systems, review tools, shipping/fulfillment‚Äîif it plugs in, I can connect it.  

- **Performance & reliability**  
  Nobody wants a site that lags on mobile or crashes during launch day. I make sure it runs smooth.  

- **Custom solutions**  
  Limited edition drops, serial number tracking, unique product pages, stuff that helps your brand stand out.

That mix, technical skill plus genuine interest, means I can help your brand grow without you stressing over the tech.
