I am constantly trying to learn and add new skills to my repertoire. There’s just something about a new challenge like trying to master a popular technology to open up new opportunities. Shopify seemed like a great option to be the next one that I tackle for a few reasons.

## It can open up opportunities to help companies outside of tech

Not every company needs a 100% custom solution because their web presence or tech stack is little more than bookkeeping and marketing. This will open up opportunities for small businesses that aren’t just the latest SaaS startup looking to be a unicorn and get seed money.

## It gives me perspectives on a successful tech company

I completed the [Shopify Development Fundamentals Path](https://www.shopifyacademy.com/path/shopify-development-fundamentals) and just going through that, I could see some of the architecture decisions made at Shopify. They clearly have some things figured out as they are the best online store SaaS out there. So taking the time to look at how they have structured their plugin system, and their databases that users have access to is just another example of how to architect an application. I’m always interested in seeing how successful companies architect their tech as I try to become a skilled software architect myself.)

## Learning is just fun

I made a fake store using fake data as part of the path, and it was just fun. One of the features you add in the path is custom info on certain listings, giving the clothing models dimensions. Which seems to be a more and more common thing in online stores. So I just had fun with that, gave the models obscure names and insane dimensions while still completing the work necessary to learn the tech.

More of a shorter post here. I’m trying to get back into it, so you might see a lot more of these coming up, but this is the best way for me to disseminate news like this.

If this is something that you think could potentially help you, I consult, freelance, and help out all sorts of companies. Including, including now companies that run a Shopify store.

Cheers.
