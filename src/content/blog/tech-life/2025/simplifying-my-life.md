Recently, I have felt dissatisfied with the way I have been chosing to live my life. Overwhelmed, overworked, dissatisfied, stressed, you name it.

## Wearing a dumb watch more and my Apple Watch less

## Deleted any time suck apps

## Unsubscribe from Emails and podcasts

## Tech free times

### Pen and paper

## Stopped caring about generating data

### I cancelled my arccos subscription

## Take walks without a podcast
