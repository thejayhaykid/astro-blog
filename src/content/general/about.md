# About Me

Hello there! I’m Jake Hayes, a lead software engineer with 7 years of experience in the industry. From an early age, I’ve had a natural affinity for computers and technology, which fueled my passion for problem-solving.

As a full stack developer, my expertise lies in React and frontend development. I’ve had the opportunity to lead total app rewrites, transforming outdated systems into modern React frontends, combined with various backend technologies. Additionally, I’ve gained valuable experience through my consulting work.

At my previous company, I was honored with the title of “frontend champion” within my team. This recognition acknowledged my deep knowledge and expertise in frontend development.

What truly motivates me is the never-ending learning journey. I embrace the concept of being a “T-shaped” developer, continuously expanding my skills across different areas of software engineering.

Beyond my professional life, I find immense joy in my family. I’ve been happily married for over 8 years and have two wonderful little girls who inspire me every day.

Software development isn’t just my job; it’s my professional hobby. However, when I’m not immersed in code, you’ll likely find me on the golf course, indulging in my love for the sport.

Interestingly, I initially pursued a major in Geographic Information Science, which granted me a unique perspective. I also studied design, granting me insights into the collaborative processes with UX designers.

I’m excited to connect, collaborate, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of software development. Let’s build innovative solutions together!
