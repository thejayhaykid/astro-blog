## About Me

I'm a Staff Software Engineer with a decade of experience designing and building scalable, user-facing systems. I’ve led high-impact projects across growth-stage startups and mature platforms, shipping features end-to-end and guiding teams through architecture decisions, refactors, and roadmap pivots.

Lately, I’ve been channeling that experience into building my own apps — starting with a Gym Clock app for Apple TV — and advising early-stage founders on how to turn scrappy code into stable, scalable products.

I’m especially drawn to the messy middle of product development: where engineering decisions directly shape the customer experience, and speed has to be balanced with sustainability. If you’re a founder wrestling with technical debt, platform choices, or how to scale your system (or team), I’d love to help.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me with my family, watching sports, reading, or trying to catch-up on a multi-year long backlog of videogames.
